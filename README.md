# DashRing-Plus
Fixes the DashRing not disappearing after use.


Simply throw the included DashRing.arc file into your ObjectData folder, and you're good to go!

Credit: Not required. This is a tiny addition with very niche uses, however, if you'd like to credit me, use the name "Syreyup" to do so!

Enjoy!
